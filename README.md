# PUSH_SWAP
The push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.  This project contains 2 programs:  The first, named checker which takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard output. Once read,checker executes them and displays OK if integersare sorted. Otherwise, it will display KO. The second one called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest progam using push_swap instruction language that sorts inte-ger arguments received.
